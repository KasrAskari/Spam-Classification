# 📧 Spam Classification with LSTM

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **spam classification model** built using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network. It identifies unwanted messages by analyzing text messages and classifying them as **spam** or **not spam**. The model leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **deep learning techniques** to process and classify text.
