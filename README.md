# 📧 Spam Classification  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **spam classification model** designed to identify unwanted messages. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning algorithms**, it analyzes text messages and classifies them as **spam** or **not spam**.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Text Processing:** Cleaning and preparing text data  
✔ **Model Training:** Using classification algorithms like Naïve Bayes and SVM  
✔ **Feature Extraction:** Converting text to numerical features using TF-IDF  
✔ **Model Evaluation:** Measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
